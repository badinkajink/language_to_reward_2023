# Set the torso targets
# Since the robot should face north, the heading is pi/2 (90 degrees converted to radians)
# The robot should go to location (0.0, 0.0), so we set the target_torso_location_xy
# Since we're setting a location, the target_torso_velocity_xy must be None
# We're not setting a turning speed, so target_turning_speed must be None
set_torso_targets(0.25, 0, 0, (0.0, 0.0), None, np.pi/2, None)

# Since the task does not specify any particular foot movement, we will not call set_foot_pos_parameters
# We also do not have any specific stepping parameters, so we will not call set_foot_stepping_parameters

# Execute the plan for the default duration of 2 seconds

[start of description]
* This is a new task.
* The torso of the robot should roll by 0 degrees towards right, the torso should pitch upward at 0 degrees.
* The height of the robot's CoM or torso center should be at 0.4 meters.
* The robot should turn at certain speed. It should turn at 10 degrees/s.
* The robot should move at certain speed. It should move forward at 0.5m/s and sideways at 0.0m/s.
* [optional] front_left foot steps on the ground at a frequency of 2.0 Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move 0.05 meters up and down, and 0.1 meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking forward, spending 0.3 portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
* [optional] back_left foot steps on the ground at a frequency of 2.0 Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move 0.05 meters up and down, and 0.1 meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking forward, spending 0.3 portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
* [optional] front_right foot steps on the ground at a frequency of 2.0 Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move 0.05 meters up and down, and 0.1 meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking forward, spending 0.3 portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
* [optional] back_right foot steps on the ground at a frequency of 2.0 Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move 0.05 meters up and down, and 0.1 meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking forward, spending 0.3 portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
* [optional] The phase offsets for the four legs should be front_left: 0.0, back_left: 0.5, front_right: 0.5, back_right: 0.0.
