* front_right foot steps on the ground at a frequency of 1.0 Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move 0.03 meters up and down, and 0.05 meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking back, spending 0.15 portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
* back_right foot steps on the ground at a frequency of 1.0 Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move 0.03 meters up and down, and 0.05 meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking back, spending 0.15 portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
* The phase offsets for the four legs should be front_left: 0.0, back_left: 0.5, front_right: 0.5, back_right: 0.0.
